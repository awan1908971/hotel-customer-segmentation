## 📈 Key Insights  

### **1. Demographic Insights**  
- Majority of customers are aged **21–40** and **41–60**  
- Customers under age 20 represent a very small portion

### **2. Segmentation Insights**  
Customer segments (from clustering):
- **At Risk (~27%)** → largest segment  
- **Loyal (~27%)**  
- **Potential (~25%)**  
- **Champions (~20%)** → smallest segment  

Balanced distribution indicates segmentation model is stable.
